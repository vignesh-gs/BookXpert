# Bookxpert – Task 1 & Task 2

This repo has two projects: a name-matching system (Task 1) and a recipe chatbot (Task 2). Each has its own folder, README, and requirements.

## Task 1 – Name matching

Finds the best-matching names from a dataset for a query. Handles punctuation, transliteration (e.g. Geetha/Gita), initials, and typos.

**Go to:** [task1_name_match/](task1_name_match/)  
**Setup and run:** See [task1_name_match/README.md](task1_name_match/README.md)

## Task 2 – Recipe chatbot

You give ingredients (e.g. "egg, onion"); it returns a recipe. Runs as a local API and CLI. The trained model (adapter) is included so you don’t need to train.

**Go to:** [task2/](task2/)  
**Setup and run:** See [task2/README.md](task2/README.md)

## Setup

Each task has its own README and `requirements.txt`. Open the task folder and follow that README.
